# Orchestrated-Domain-Driven-Data-Mesh-Analytics

# 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full-stack data analytics pipeline that combines domain-driven design, data mesh architecture, and real-time streaming analytics using PySpark, Delta Lake, and Power BI. It simulates realistic business domains, orchestrates scalable data workflows, and delivers insights through both code and dashboards.

The goal is to showcase how modern data platforms can be built with modularity, reproducibility, and business relevance — from raw simulation to curated insights.
